Dear {{ session.baker.username }},

The cakeclub is calling upon you to bake on {{ session.date }}!
Currently, we are expecting {{ len(session.participants) }} hungry mouths to
feed.

If you can't bake for any reason, you should quickly arrange a replacement!

Kindest regards,
Your Impartial Overlord
(on behalf of the Cake Club)
