Dear {{ names }},

The cakeclub is calling upon you to bake this week on {{ session.date }}!
Currently, we are expecting {{ participant_nbr }} hungry mouths to
feed.

If you can't bake for any reason, you should quickly arrange a replacement!

Kindest regards,
Your Impartial Overlord
(on behalf of the Cake Club)
